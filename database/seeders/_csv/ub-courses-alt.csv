Intermediate Arabic I,"In this class we will continue to work on both Standard Written Arabic and the Egyptian dialect (Al Kittab) The UB Arabic program is for you to become fluent readers of media Arabic and reasonably proficient writers and listeners. This is not likely to happen in a couple of semesters, but the goal for this class is to continue introducing you to the basic structures of Arabic, to expand your vocabulary in key areas, and for you to make progress in developing reading and speaking fluency. Specific functional goals for you to accomplish in 103 include the ability to: read and write personal letters; talk with ease about your extended family, hobbies, studies, health and medical needs; ask and give directions to find places in an Arab city; shop and barter. You?ll also learn a number of social formulae that will allow you to interact in a more Arab-like manner, including knowing more proverbs. We will cover Lessons 1-7 (Lessons 1-3 were introduced in the previous level) in Al-Kitaab, Class will be similar to 102, but reading and writing will be emphasized more, since you are now better at it. It is important to start to get a little better this semester in distinguishing Written from Spoken Arabic and learning when to use one or the other (or to mix). Again, this will not be completely accomplished this semester, but the goal is for you to get much better at it than you were last semester. Please make a special effort to use only Arabic in class. Talk with your classmates in Arabic; ask questions in Arabic (even if you need to occasionally use an English word or two). Overcome your shyness (at least as far as Arabic is concerned). You need to practice to make progress. Go ahead; make a fool of yourself (it?s an assignment)! Unless you can reasonably ask your question in Arabic (try!), please ask your questions about culture and linguistic details before or after class or via email so we can save class discussion for Arabic.",Arabic Language,Arabic Language,,,Arabic Language,103,Undergraduate,Arabc-102:,Main Campus,Modern languages,ARABC-103,2924,2/26/2021 6:15,Item,Lists/Courses

Computational Fluid Dynamics,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed in a wide range of industries and disciplines, such as aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, biomedical science and engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, power engineering and sports engineering.  Practicing engineers are constantly facing extreme challenges to solve complex fluid flow and heat transfer problems using commercial CFD software.  To avoid flawed CFD simulation and results interpretation using commercial CFD packages by users with inadequate training, understanding the fundamental principles that underlie commercial CFD solvers can help the users to effectively harness the power of modern CFD for their research or design. This course is an introduction to the scientific principles and practical engineering applications of CFD.  It combines lectures on the CFD principles with projects of research or industrial applications. The emphasis of this course is not to teach the theory behind the CFD techniques, but to help the students apply the knowledge gained into practical use of commercial CFD software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and/or STAR-CCM+).  Students will first learn the complete CFD process from modeling and approximation, mesh design, computation, to results interpretation through lectures and case studies.  The necessary theoretical background in fluid mechanics and heat transfer will be covered in these case studies. Tutorials will be provided to show how to set up, run and interpret the results of CFD models in a commercial code, COMSOL. Students will then work in a project team to solve selected research or industrial fluid flow and/or heat transfer problems in their own field (such as mechanical systems, electronics systems, or biomedical systems) using CFD",Mechanical Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,,,Mechanical Engineering,512,Graduate,,Main Campus,,MEEG-512,2980,2/26/2021 6:15,Item,Lists/Courses

The Soundtrack,"Thanks to a variety of social and technological motivating factors, communication (both commercial/industrial and personal) is increasingly based on video and motion-images. These moving images are generally accompanied by some sort of soundtrack. It is within the space defined by the synchronized sound/image that the full expressive power of much modern communication is located. SASD design education gives students many opportunities to think critically about visual signification and practices. Although design students may not have chosen to explore and work with audio as a field of study, designers cannot ignore the significant ways in which visual signification can be altered, strengthened, and subverted by the audio that may accompany it. GDSN 232 'The Soundtrack' will give the design student an opportunity to learn and understand the basic ways that sound and image can work together to create meaning and express ideas. Even if the design student never engages in audio-production-processes beyond the term of the course, they will gain an understanding of the concepts and basic terminology of sound as it applies in synchronization with image. This will allow the student to be a more effective designer and communicator in any situation where sound will accompany their visual work.

Computational Fluid Dynamics,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed in a wide range of industries and disciplines, such as aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, biomedical science and engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, power engineering and sports engineering.  Practicing engineers are constantly facing extreme challenges to solve complex fluid flow and heat transfer problems using commercial CFD software.  To avoid flawed CFD simulation and results interpretation using commercial CFD packages by users with inadequate training, understanding the fundamental principles that underlie commercial CFD solvers can help the users to effectively harness the power of modern CFD for their research or design. This course is an introduction to the scientific principles and practical engineering applications of CFD.  It combines lectures on the CFD principles with projects of research or industrial applications. The emphasis of this course is not to teach the theory behind the CFD techniques, but to help the students apply the knowledge gained into practical use of commercial CFD software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and/or STAR-CCM+).  Students will first learn the complete CFD process from modeling and approximation, mesh design, computation, to results interpretation through lectures and case studies.  The necessary theoretical background in fluid mechanics and heat transfer will be covered in these case studies. Tutorials will be provided to show how to set up, run and interpret the results of CFD models in a commercial code, COMSOL. Students will then work in a project team to solve selected research or industrial fluid flow and/or heat transfer problems in their own field (such as mechanical systems, electronics systems, or biomedical systems) using CFD",Biomedical Engineering,Biomedical Engineering,,,Biomedical Engineering,512,Graduate,,Main Campus; Distance Learning-On Line,,BMEG-512,3634,2/26/2021 6:15,Item,Lists/Courses

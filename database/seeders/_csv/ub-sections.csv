This is not likely to happen in a couple of semesters, but the goal for this class is to continue introducing you to the basic structures of Arabic, to expand your vocabulary in key areas, and for you to make progress in developing reading and speaking fluency. Specific functional goals for you to accomplish in 103 include the ability to: read and write personal letters; talk with ease about your extended family, hobbies, studies, health and medical needs; ask and give directions to find places in an Arab city; shop and barter. You?ll also learn a number of social formulae that will allow you to interact in a more Arab-like manner, including knowing more proverbs. We will cover Lessons 1-7 (Lessons 1-3 were introduced in the previous level) in Al-Kitaab, Class will be similar to 102, but reading and writing will be emphasized more, since you are now better at it. It is important to start to get a little better this semester in distinguishing Written from Spoken Arabic and learning when to use one or the other (or to mix). Again, this will not be completely accomplished this semester, but the goal is for you to get much better at it than you were last semester. Please make a special effort to use only Arabic in class. Talk with your classmates in Arabic; ask questions in Arabic (even if you need to occasionally use an English word or two). Overcome your shyness (at least as far as Arabic is concerned). You need to practice to make progress. Go ahead; make a fool of yourself (it?s an assignment)!

In this series, we discover the challenges and rewards of various life stages. We discuss biological, cognitive, emotional and social change through the lifespan and relate the course material to our own lives.  This course engages us in important questions about health, longevity, aging, death and dying and life and living. We will emphasize the topics of healthy living, ageism, grief, bereavement and the dying process as it relates to individuals and to caregivers.  We will consider historical and cultural differences, but will focus on present day American life. We will also consider the many positive aspects and rewards of the aging and dying process. Perhaps most importantly, we'll emphasize making the most of our lives given the inevitability of our own aging death.   The course will be interactive and focused on our own experiences and reactions. There will be a series of current, original readings that we will discuss in class. We will watch at least one video that deals with aging and another that deals with death and dying. We will have a series of guest speakers who will share their work.

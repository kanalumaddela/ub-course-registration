The beginning of this course will consist of an extensive review of the basics learned in the first part of the course.  We will then follow the story of Maha and her family we will, at the same time, expand our vocabulary, go into more complex grammar structures, and learn more about Arab culture.  The ?multiplicity? of the Arabic language and the coexistence of spoken and written standard Arabic are also addressed in order to prepare the student for the complex reality of the language.  This course addresses all four communication skills (reading, speaking, listening and writing.) The videos watched in class and the CD?s used at home are a crucial part of the course.  They take us to native speakers in their normal cultural environment. Let us remember that Arabic is spoken in 22 countries, some of which were the birthplaces of great ancient civilizations.  Arabic is the language of the Islamic religion.  It is also a great asset to have in today?s job market.",

        "description": "In this class we will continue to work on both Standard Written Arabic and the Egyptian dialect (Al Kittab) The UB Arabic program is for you to become fluent readers of media Arabic and reasonably proficient writers and listeners. This is not likely to happen in a couple of semesters, but the goal for this class is to continue introducing you to the basic structures of Arabic, to expand your vocabulary in key areas, and for you to make progress in developing reading and speaking fluency. Specific functional goals for you to accomplish in 103 include the ability to: read and write personal letters; talk with ease about your extended family, hobbies, studies, health and medical needs; ask and give directions to find places in an Arab city; shop and barter. You?ll also learn a number of social formulae that will allow you to interact in a more Arab-like manner, including knowing more proverbs. We will cover Lessons 1-7 (Lessons 1-3 were introduced in the previous level) in Al-Kitaab, Class will be similar to 102, but reading and writing will be emphasized more, since you are now better at it. It is important to start to get a little better this semester in distinguishing Written from Spoken Arabic and learning when to use one or the other (or to mix). Again, this will not be completely accomplished this semester, but the goal is for you to get much better at it than you were last semester. Please make a special effort to use only Arabic in class. Talk with your classmates in Arabic; ask questions in Arabic (even if you need to occasionally use an English word or two). Overcome your shyness (at least as far as Arabic is concerned). You need to practice to make progress. Go ahead; make a fool of yourself (it?s an assignment)! Unless you can reasonably ask your question in Arabic (try!), please ask your questions about culture and linguistic details before or after class or via email so we can save class discussion for Arabic.",

Practicing engineers are constantly facing extreme challenges to solve complex fluid flow and heat transfer problems using commercial CFD software.  To avoid flawed CFD simulation and results interpretation using commercial CFD packages by users with inadequate training, understanding the fundamental principles that underlie commercial CFD solvers can help the users to effectively harness the power of modern CFD for their research or design. This course is an introduction to the scientific principles and practical engineering applications of CFD.  It combines lectures on the CFD principles with projects of research or industrial applications. The emphasis of this course is not to teach the theory behind the CFD techniques, but to help the students apply the knowledge gained into practical use of commercial CFD software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and\/or STAR-CCM+).  Students will first learn the complete CFD process from modeling and approximation, mesh design, computation, to results interpretation through lectures and case studies.  The necessary theoretical background in fluid mechanics and heat transfer will be covered in these case studies. Tutorials will be provided to show how to set up, run and interpret the results of CFD models in a commercial code, COMSOL. Students will then work in a project team to solve selected research or industrial fluid flow and\/or heat transfer problems in their own field (such as mechanical systems, electronics systems, or biomedical systems) using CFD",

The course includes a good amount of background review to get all students to an equivalent level, but primarily lectures will follow a seminar style structure. This implies course work includes readings, presentations and discussion of technical papers taken from the currently available IoT literature. Seminar style requires active student participation in both the presentations and in the discussions. Prior to the class \/ seminar, students are required to review an assigned article. Then we will have a thorough and interactive discussion in the classroom. The course syllabus will intentionally adapt to the interests and backgrounds of the students. This course will focus more narrowly on just a few key areas. Class lectures will be a combination of review of relevant networking material and presentation of papers from the current literature on the Internet of Things. Depending on length and complexity, the class will typically cover one or more research papers per week in class. Students should try to submit papers that they would be both qualified and interested in presenting in class.

First, we begin by reviewing how criminal procedure relates to desired standards of democracy and the rule of law. Taking a topic approach organized according to the chronological phases of the criminal process, we examine five distinct stages of this process: (1) investigation, (2) arrest, search, and seizure, and (3) interrogation, (4) pre-trial court procedures, and (5) the trial itself. In each phase,students first examine criminal procedure principles and practices in the U.S., and then examine these principles and practices in 12 other countries, including England, France, Germany, and Italy from Europe; Russia (exemplifying the post-Soviet world), Israel (illustrating a \"security state\"), Egypt and South Africa representing Africa, and Argentina and Mexico representing Latin America. Third, we turn our attention to reform movements abroad, with particular attention to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) and Latin America, including recent reforms in Chile and ongoing reforms in Colombia and Mexico. This section highlights the origins of these reform movements and the assessment of the effects of reform. Finally, drawing on the insights gathered from the comparative analysis above, we return to the U.S. to examine how best practices identified elsewhere compare with current practices here at home.",

Given the current events that are dominating headlines, which deals with the issue of race, gender and class, this course will ask the following questions: What are the historical roots of inequality? How do we define agency of marginal groups? Is the black freedom struggle ongoing? Have we achieved a post racial society? ",

As such, analysis of global media markets will include defining the characteristics of the various end user profiles; determining the size and segmentation of media revenue streams by regions and nations; exploring technology infrastructures and topography issues that impact media adoption rates; and the influence of media market drivers, such as demographics, cultural mores, political environments, and economic stability, or lack thereof, on media consumption trends.

It will also study the innovative non- Western models of development such as micro-credit in South Asian and the Confucian- influenced models of development in parts of East and Southeast Asia. This course will identify the ways in which Western cultural assumptions can clash with the cultural underpinnings of many less developed countries. Using the case study method, learners will identify ways in which potential clashes are anticipated based on a region?s history and its cultural underpinnings. Learners will assess the strategies currently used to address development-related challenges and, when appropriate, propose alternative strategies. 3 Semester Hours",

These moving images are generally accompanied by some sort of soundtrack. It is within the space defined by the synchronized sound\/image that the full expressive power of much modern communication is located. SASD design education gives students many opportunities to think critically about visual signification and practices. Although design students may not have chosen to explore and work with audio as a field of study, designers cannot ignore the significant ways in which visual signification can be altered, strengthened, and subverted by the audio that may accompany it. GDSN 232 'The Soundtrack' will give the design student an opportunity to learn and understand the basic ways that sound and image can work together to create meaning and express ideas. Even if the design student never engages in audio-production-processes beyond the term of the course, they will gain an understanding of the concepts and basic terminology of sound as it applies in synchronization with image. This will allow the student to be a more effective designer and communicator in any situation where sound will accompany their visual work. ",

The course focuses both on how the natural environment shaped the growth of North American civilizations and on how evolving modes of economic production changed various Americans' relationship to nature and their ideas about it. Special attention goes to how Native people's original connection to the land gave way to European settlers' land use, how preseNationist ideas behind the U.S.'s great American park system collided with local people's traditional uses of natural resources, and how naturalist Rachel Carson's blockbuster book Silent Spring contributed to growing ecological consciousness among Americans and the rise of the modern environment movement in the 1960s.",

This course will  illustrate both IT and Quantitative Methods  through three fairly involved examples and  extensive hands-on experience.  Cleaning data  will lead us to database principles that underlie  data independence and referential integrity.   Summarizing a modest-sized dataset (about 8,000  rows) will introduce statistical summaries, some  basic visualization tools, and the statistics  behind correlation coefficients and matrices.   Pivot Tables and various visualization techniques  will allow us to answer the question, \"What is  the data telling us?\"  The final project allow us  to apply results from calculus to generate  forecasts which we will then visually and  statistically compare by using 3-D graphics and  hypothesis testing.  We will use the computer for  the entire course; nothing is done by hand.",

Taiji 4 reviews Taiji?s principles and communicates how the Taiji form performance is assessed based on the principles. Both the self-defense aspects and the self-cultivation aspects (of body, mind & spirit) of the Yang Style Short Form will be presented. The class will stress ongoing individual Taiji training and students will be encouraged to develop individual Taiji training formats. This class also presents training and information required to lead Qigong classes on the entire set of twelve exercises. Prerequisite: Marts 123 or Instructor?s Approval based on Testing. 1 semester hour",

The historical information gleaned from these sources is compared to the narratives and mythologies passed down through the written and oral traditions of the various schools. We examine the unfolding of the Shaolin Gongfu schools influenced by Chan as well as the Wudang tradition influenced by Daoism, the emergence of Martial Arts in the Hwarang movement of the Korean Silla kingdom and their revival after the Japanese occupation, and the transformation of Gongfu traditions in Japan via Okinawa. 3 semester hours",

In the review of the linkage between Daoism and Taiji we will focus on the cosmology of the Book of Changes, which informs the conceptual framework of Taiji, as well as influential Daoist concepts such as Wu Wei (No Action), Yin and Yang and passive values as depicted in the Laozi, Zhuangzi, the Book of Changes, and the Taijiquan Treatise. 3 semester hours",

Practicing engineers are constantly facing extreme challenges to solve complex fluid flow and heat transfer problems using commercial CFD software.  To avoid flawed CFD simulation and results interpretation using commercial CFD packages by users with inadequate training, understanding the fundamental principles that underlie commercial CFD solvers can help the users to effectively harness the power of modern CFD for their research or design. This course is an introduction to the scientific principles and practical engineering applications of CFD.  It combines lectures on the CFD principles with projects of research or industrial applications. The emphasis of this course is not to teach the theory behind the CFD techniques, but to help the students apply the knowledge gained into practical use of commercial CFD software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and\/or STAR-CCM+).  Students will first learn the complete CFD process from modeling and approximation, mesh design, computation, to results interpretation through lectures and case studies.  The necessary theoretical background in fluid mechanics and heat transfer will be covered in these case studies. Tutorials will be provided to show how to set up, run and interpret the results of CFD models in a commercial code, COMSOL.

Aircraft and spacecraft are typical weight sensitive structures in which composite materials cost-effective. Usually, composite materials consist of two separate components, the matrix and the filler. The matrix is the component that holds the filler together and the filler makes the materials strong. Most aerospace-application composites have strong, stiff long fibers are the fillers. The fiber makes the material behaves differently in different directions. This anisotropic behavior introduces complication in the analysis of the composite material. The course introduces the student to the basic concepts of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. Specific topics include the stress-strain relation for a lamina, micromechanics of composite materials, bending, bucking, and vibration of composite plates with various laminations, fatigue, fracture mechanics, and joints of composite structures. 3 lecture hours, 3 semester hours ",

        "description": "This course aims to address the following questions: Are Islam and democracy compatible? How is religious interest defined? How are Islamic images and institutions used? What is the historical relationship between Islam and politics? When and under what conditions is Islam publicized and politicized? Is Islam compatible with modernity? Is it possible to be modern and Muslim at the same time? How do Islamic scholars deal with the questions of \"difference\", democracy, and science? The major task of this course will be to assess how religion makes an impact on politics, state and society and in turn is impacted upon and potentially transformed by society, politics and the state. Instructor's permission may be required for this course. 3 semester hours",

We discuss biological, cognitive, emotional and social change through the lifespan and relate the course material to our own lives.  This course engages us in important questions about health, longevity, aging, death and dying and life and living. We will emphasize the topics of healthy living, ageism, grief, bereavement and the dying process as it relates to individuals and to caregivers.  We will consider historical and cultural differences, but will focus on present day American life. We will also consider the many positive aspects and rewards of the aging and dying process. Perhaps most importantly, we'll emphasize making the most of our lives given the inevitability of our own aging death.   The course will be interactive and focused on our own experiences and reactions. There will be a series of current, original readings that we will discuss in class. We will watch at least one video that deals with aging and another that deals with death and dying. We will have a series of guest speakers who will share their work. Finally, we will choose two different personal experiential projects and report on our experiences.   ",

Is it possible to be modern and Muslim at the same time? How do Islamic scholars deal with the questions of \"difference\", democracy, and science? The major task of this course will be to assess how religion makes an impact on politics, state and society and in turn is impacted upon and potentially transformed by society, politics and the state.

While the West has emphasized separation of church and state, numerous nations and political parities in the Middle East emphasize the relationship between the two and the guiding role that religion is meant to play in political decision making. This course also examines the impact that secularization has had upon religion in the Middle East and it notes how this has played a key role in the development of Islamic militarism and the strengthening of some of the religiously based political parties of the religion.
